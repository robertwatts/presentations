# At the very start, being small is simple

- Everyone *involved* and *empowered* in decision making
- Instant feedback
- *No constraints* or legacy code to maintain
- Documentation is *a waste of time*

It’s a great time to be alive.

# In the beginning, growing is easy

- Every new person is AWESOME
- Easy to get started and master the codebase
- Individuals can still make big differences
- Growing the team is a buzz

---

# Things get interesting when >1 team

- Dependencies
- Boundaries
- Hand-offs
- Knowledge sharing
- Roadmap planning

---

# At this point you may encounter
# **developer disconnect**

---

# "I don't know what they're doing"

---

# "I don't know why they did that"

---

# "That doesn't affect our team"

---

# "We're blocked waiting on them"

---

# “Only [HERO_DEV] knows how to do that”

---

# "It's not like it used to be"

---

# We need to challenge these statements.

---

# A clear understanding of leadership roles

# Automated, standardised build & deployment
- Developers should code with whatever tools they choose
- BUT standardise build chain to get that code to customers, including server provisioning, deployment, CI, build and test
- Benefits: 
	- Easier to move around
	- Automate the tedium
	- Reduces silos

---

# Document things that are hard to change 
- Hard to change items are key decisions in software history
- Usually accumulate most technical debt
- Document the decision + context
- Encourage conversation on alternatives

---

# Pay down just enough technical debt


---

# Relate teams importance to the vision

---

# Empowered people do amazing things

A major pull factor for startup life is that employees are **empowered to make a difference**. 

It would be impossible to take on established industries without empowered people working at startups.

---

# This is not empowerment

Tempting people from this environment into yours is a *competitive advantage*.

---

# [fit] Growing Pains
# Invest -> Success -> Invest -> Grow

^^^ This is where it gets challenging

---

# Growing Pains

When team count > 1 we are going to need
- Planning
- Hard dependencies
- 

# Developer disconnect
What happens when developers no longer see the bigger picture


---

# Disconnect is what happens in the Enterprise, right?

No, it can happen to startups too.
