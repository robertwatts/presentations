# Hello

Hello, I’m Rob. 

I’ve been at this stuff for quite a while now.  

I’ve worked in small, medium and massive companies.  

I’ve managed teams through high growth and slow decline.

A management challenge that has always been present: purpose.

^ Been working in teams since the late 90s
Economic cycles have passed
Purpose has consistently been the difference

# [fit] This talk is about creating
# [fit] the right environment so that
# [fit] **developers feel connected**
# [fit] to your mission as your startup scales

^ So what’s this talk about?
As we scale we can’t keep everybody happy
We have tools to help 
The tools are well known
Applying at right time is the challenge

# Scaling from original team to multi dev stream complexity

^ Mapping agile growth to classic view on complexity
Lost My Name is now complex, by this diagram

# Small is simple. Small is great.

![right, 200%](http://www.robwatts.org/images/presentations/scaling-with-purpose/simple.png)

- Everyone *involved* and *empowered* in decision making
- Instant feedback
- *No constraints* or legacy code to maintain
- Documentation is *a waste of time*

It’s a great time to be alive.

^ Structure is flat
Knowledge is intuitively shared
People feel connected and empowered
Everything is new

---

# Growth is fun.

![right, 200%](http://www.robwatts.org/images/presentations/scaling-with-purpose/complicated.png)

- Every new person is AWESOME
- Quick to get started and master the codebase
- Individuals can still make big differences
- Growing the team is a buzz
- Decoupling begins

# Things always get more interesting at scale

- Dependencies
- Boundaries
- Hand-offs
- Knowledge sharing
- Roadmap alignment

# Developer Disconnect

![right, fit](http://img.memecdn.com/give-a-fuck-o-meter-cup-version_o_1919793.jpg)

Unfortunately the more you scale the more likely you are to encounter Developer Disconnect from a small number of people.

^ It only take a small number of people
Disconnect is contagious

--- 

# The 4 elements of 
# Developer Disconnect

1. **Defensiveness**
2. **Disempowerment**
3. **Detachment**
4. **Drudgery**

---

Spotting developer disconnect #1: Detachment

# [fit] “What’s **the point** 
# [fit] in doing that?”

---

Spotting developer disconnect #2: Defensiveness

# [fit] “It’s easier if I 
# [fit] **do it myself** ”

---

Spotting developer disconnect #3: Detachment

# [fit] “That doesn't affect us, it’s the
# [fit] **other teams** problem”

---

Spotting developer disconnect #4: Drudgery

# [fit] “Sorry I can’t help, 
# [fit] I have to do **[TEDIUS_TASK]**”

---

Spotting developer disconnect #5: Disempowerment

# [fit] “Only **[HERO_DEV]**
# [fit] knows how to do that”

---

Spotting developer disconnect #6

# [fit] “Working here isn’t 
# [fit] like it **used to be**”

---

# [fit] We need to challenge 
# [fit] disconnect by restoring 
# [fit] purpose


^ Purpose comes from above and below.  
It is both personal and contextual
Managers can provide it from above
We must give space for people to find it themselves.

---

# Clarity from managers
## #detachment

- CTO/VP Engineering/Head Of */Product Lead <— do they have clear meaning in your organisation?
- Leaders should deeply understand development
- Carefully manage roadmap vs vision
- Management must always present united front

![right, 100%](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mIwyT1OYw7E/VdNA55k_1TI/AAAAAAAAFzU/OgpLSozjwPM/s1600/Screen%2Bshot%2B2015-08-18%2Bat%2B10.27.22%2BAM.png)

^ Confusion spreads easily
Give people solveable problems - targeted goals
CTO and VP Eng pulling in different directions 

---

# Break down silos
## #defensiveness

- No heroes for low bus factor
- Discipline meetups
- Cross functional squads around key deliverables
- Persistent teams with rotation
- Mini conferences / away days

![right](http://images.adsttc.com/media/images/51ed/521e/e8e4/4eff/9f00/0119/large_jpg/Tim_Hursley_moon_fire_2.jpg?1374507532)

^ Promote communication between teams
Don’t allow “heroes” - force them to share.  
Heroes can’t scale, they might be amazing at the start but can detract in later stages
Rotation: Developers most useful during first 3 months

---


# Automated build & deployment
## #drudgery

- Developers should code with whatever tools they choose
- BUT standardise build chain to get that code to customers, including server provisioning, deployment, CI, build and test

![right](https://mysuthings.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/chain.gif?w=687)

^ Automate the tedium.  
Build and deployment the biggest problem
Blocker to your investment being in the hands of customers
Include monitoring, alerting
Reduce noisy apps

---

# Document hard to change things
## #disempowerment

- These are the key decisions in software history
- Usually accumulate most technical debt
- Document context
- Create time for alternatives and build backlog

![right, 90%](http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1389.jpg)

^ Definition: Architecture is the hard to change things
Everything else is just development
Too often in startups these decisions are lost in time
People feel they cannot change
Make space to tackle bad decisions or developers won’t take risks

---

# Pay down technical debt
## #disempowerment

- Make space in sprints and roadmap
- Developers want to feel they are improving the system
- Don’t be a feature slave

![right, fit](http://www.darwinsmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/debt-slave.jpg)

^ In quest to find value in startup we create tech debt
It’s hard to know what debt will be expensive or throwaway
Developers find it even harder to know the difference
A sense of “new features over anything else” can be toxic
Show commitment to valuable software by making space in sprints to pay for debt

---

# Summary
Fight developer disconnect by ensuring there’s purpose from above and below.

We can beat disconnect by
1. Defensiveness —> Break down silos
2. Disempowerment —> Document, Pay down tech debt
3. Detachment —> Clear leadership and intra-team comms
4. Drudgery —> Automate

But remember: you can’t take everyone with you.

^ Of course your own context dictates which of these could unlock the best result
You cannot take everyone with you
Sometimes the company grows faster than the people in it
