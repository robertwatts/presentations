# Hello

Hello, I’m Rob. 

I’ve been at this stuff for quite a while now.  

I’ve worked in small, medium and massive companies.  

I’ve managed teams through high growth and slow decline.

A management challenge that has always been present: purpose.

# Small is simple. Small is great.

- Everyone *involved* and *empowered* in decision making
- Instant feedback
- *No constraints* or legacy code to maintain
- Documentation is *a waste of time*

It’s a great time to be alive.

# Developer Disconnect

![right, fit](http://img.memecdn.com/give-a-fuck-o-meter-cup-version_o_1919793.jpg)

Unfortunately the more you scale the more likely you are to encounter Developer Disconnect from a small number of people.

# The 4 elements of 
# Developer Disconnect

1. **Defensiveness**
2. **Disempowerment**
3. **Detachment**
4. **Drudgery**

---

Spotting developer disconnect #1: Detachment

# [fit] “What’s **the point** 
# [fit] in doing that?”

---

Spotting developer disconnect #2: Defensiveness

# [fit] “It’s easier if I 
# [fit] **do it myself** ”

---

Spotting developer disconnect #3: Detachment

# [fit] “That doesn't affect us, it’s the
# [fit] **other teams** problem”

---

Spotting developer disconnect #4: Drudgery

# [fit] “Sorry I can’t help, 
# [fit] I have to do **[TEDIUS_TASK]**”

---

Spotting developer disconnect #5: Disempowerment

# [fit] “Only **[HERO_DEV]**
# [fit] knows how to do that”

---

Spotting developer disconnect #6

# [fit] “Working here isn’t 
# [fit] like it **used to be**”

---

# [fit] We need to challenge 
# [fit] disconnect by restoring 
# [fit] purpose

^ Purpose comes from above and below.  We can describe it from above but we must give space for people to find it themselves.

---

# Clarity from managers
## #detachment

- CTO/VP Engineering/Head Of */Product Lead <— do they have clear meaning in your organisation?
- Leaders should deeply understand development
- Carefully manage roadmap vs vision
- Management must always present united front

# Break down silos
## #defensiveness

- No heroes for low bus factor
- Discipline meetups
- Cross functional squads around key deliverables
- Continuous teams with frequent rotation
- Mini conferences / away days

# Automated build & deployment
## #drudgery

- Developers should code with whatever tools they choose
- BUT standardise build chain to get that code to customers, including server provisioning, deployment, CI, build and test

![right](https://mysuthings.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/chain.gif?w=687)

^ Automate the tedium.  People can move easily.  Reduce silos

---

# Document hard to change things
## #disempowerment

- These are the key decisions in software history
- Usually accumulate most technical debt
- Document context
- Create space for alternatives and build backlog

![right, 90%](http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1389.jpg)

---

# Pay down technical debt
## #disempowerment

- Make space in sprints and roadmap
- Developers want to feel they are improving the system
- Don’t be a feature slave

# Summary
Fight developer disconnect by ensuring there’s purpose from above and below.

We can beat disconnect by
1. Defensiveness —> Break down silos
2. Disempowerment —> Document, Pay down tech debt
3. Detachment —> Clear leadership and intra-team comms
4. Drudgery —> Automate

But remember: you can’t take everyone with you.
