- Developers should code with whatever tools they choose
- BUT standardise build chain to get that code to customers, including server provisioning, deployment, CI, build and test
- Benefits: 
	- Easier to move around
	- Automate the tedium
	- Reduces silos

# Document things that are hard to change 
- Hard to change items are key decisions in software history
- Usually accumulate most technical debt
- Document the decision + context
- Encourage conversation on alternatives

# Pay down (just enough) technical debt

---

# Architecture is not a dirty word

---

# Relate teams importance to the vision
